Below is the step by step guide explaining how you can run the application into your local system.

1. Clone the repo
   ```

   ```
2. Install dependencies.
   The project folder contains a client and a server folder. To install the required dependencies, run the following command on both folders

   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application.
   Both the client and the server folders have to be run seperately. Open two terminals, navigate to each folder and run the following command
   ```
   cd server
   npm start
   ```
   ```
   cd client
   npm start
   ```
